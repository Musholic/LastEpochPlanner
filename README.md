# Path of Building Community Fork *For Last Epoch*

This is a fork of Path Of Building adapted to work for the game Last Epoch. The following features are supported (or partially):
* Passive tree: stats are displayed but most of them have no effect (or not the intended one)
* Character import: for offline character

Note that **most content (docs or code) is outdated** since they only apply to the original project. Everything should be migrated as time goes by.
