VERSION[0.3.0][2024/04/16]

There are still a lot of unrecognized mods but DPS indication can already provide useful feedback for several skills.

There is no support yet for ailments and DoT.

* Skill nodes only affect the related skill
* Support for skill added damage effectiveness, increased damage scaling per attribute, cooldown, cast time, critical chance
* Support for several mods: more damage in skill nodes, cooldown, cast speed, elemental damage, per attribute suffixes ...

* Guess main skill at import time (based on DPS calculation somehow)
* Support for weapon attack rate for attack skills

VERSION[0.2.0][2024/04/09]

--- New to Last Epoch Planner ---

This release introduces DPS calculation. It takes into account a large variety of skills, but it does not support yet a lot of mods.

So do not expect passives in the skill tree to have the intended effect for example. What is probably working is mods like "+x melee physical damage" or "x% increased fire damage"

* Basic DPS calculation support for several skills
* Fixed several mods from imported data (display value)
* A bit of cleaning (removing some irrelevant files)
* A few minor fixes (save/load fix, display of damage types in breakdown,...)

VERSION[0.1.0][2024/04/02]
First release, it started as a fork of Last Epoch Planner which is slowly adapted to Last Epoch
so most content is not yet relevant to the game.

The following features are supported (or partially):
* Passive tree
* Character import: for offline character and from LE tools build planner
* Most stats and mods/affixes are not working correctly (either not recognized or not applied correctly)
* Items: Imported from character import and can be crafted / modified
* Unique items (no support for legendary yet)
* Basic support for following stat calculation: health, mana, armor, attributes
* Skills: Can select up to 5 skills which allows to spend points in the associated skill trees

Note that online character import is not directly available,
but you can import from Last Epoch Tools build planner (which can do online character import).
